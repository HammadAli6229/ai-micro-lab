## 🗣️ 1. Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses

A simple chatbot built using **if-else logic** or **pattern matching** to generate responses based on predefined rules.

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- Basic Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Static conversation flow
- Conditional logic-based response generation

> Perfect for understanding how chatbots process and respond to user input without machine learning.

## 👁️ 2. Face Detection & Recognition

An AI-based project that uses **Haar Cascades** to detect human faces in real-time through a webcam feed.

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- OpenCV and Haar-like feature detection
- Real-time face localization
- Introduction to computer vision

> A practical example of how facial recognition systems work in surveillance and authentication.

## 🎮 3. Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Unbeatable)

A Python implementation of the classic game, where an AI plays against a human using the **Minimax algorithm** (optionally with **Alpha-Beta Pruning**).

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- Game Theory
- Adversarial Search
- Minimax & Alpha-Beta Pruning

> Learn how intelligent agents make optimal decisions in competitive environments.
